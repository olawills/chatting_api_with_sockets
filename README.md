## Chatting API With SOCKET.IO

<p>There is only one file in this repo named app.js</p>
<p>This file shows a simple implementation of how to use socket and express js</p>
<p>The file basically connects to the socket and within each connection it contains the socket connection for both the messenger and the receiver</p>

<h3>Future Feature to come to the API</h3>

<ul>
    <p> Structure to the Files</p>
    <p> Connect to Database with MONGO DB</p>
    <p> Add Group Chatting </p>
    <p> Save users to Database </p>
</ul>
